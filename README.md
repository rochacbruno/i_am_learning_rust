# I am learning Rust

This is the repository of my Rust exercices
mostly taken from **Essential Rust** and **The Rust Programming Language** books
and also from **exercism.io**.

All the code is commented with my notes about what I am incrementally learning.

For sure I'll commit mistakes in terms of idiomatic rust and code styling so
Pull Requests are welcome if you want to correct some of my mistakes.
